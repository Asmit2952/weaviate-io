## Reporting Bugs

This section walks you through the process of submitting a bug report for Weaviate. Following these guidelines can help you make a better bug report, and make it easier for the maintainers and the community to understand and reproduce your behavior and find related bugs.

When filling out the [bug report template](https://github.com/semi-technologies/weaviate-io/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/report_bug.yml), be sure to include all the steps you would take to reproduce the bug. 

## How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/semi-technologies/weaviate/issues). Be sure to check the current issues to see if the bug has already been reported.. Once you've determined which repository your bug is related to, open an issue in that repository and fill out the [template](https://github.com/semi-technologies/weaviate-io/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/report_bug.yml) with the following information.

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps** that you took to reproduce the problem in as much detail as possible. Explain how you did it. For example, while setting up Weaviate, state what was your custom configurations, which modules did you use or which command exactly you used in the terminal. 
* **Give specific examples** to show the bug. Include links to files or GitHub projects, as well as copy/pasteable snippets from the examples. For snippets, try to use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines) rather than images or animated GIFs.
* Explain what **you expected to see instead** and why.
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.
* If the problem was not caused by a specific action, describe what you were doing before the problem occurred and provide the additional information.
