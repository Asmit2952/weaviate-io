We include brief guidelines below for submitting bug reports. These guidelines are designed to make it easier for the maintainers and the community to understand the report and to quash that bug.

## How to write bug reports

Bug reports are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/semi-technologies/weaviate/issues).

Once you've determined which repository your bug is related to, check first for a duplicate WIP (work in progress) issue.

If not, open an issue in that repository and fill out the [template](https://github.com/semi-technologies/weaviate-io/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/report_bug.yml) with the following information.

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps** that you took to reproduce the problem in as much detail as possible. Explain how you did it. For example, include any custom Weaviate configurations, modules used or shell commands. 
* **Give specific examples** to show the bug. Include links to files or GitHub projects, as well as code snippets. For snippets, try to use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines) rather than images or animated GIFs.
* Explain what **you expected to see instead** and why.
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.
* If the problem was not caused by a specific action, describe what you were doing before the problem occurred and provide the additional information.
