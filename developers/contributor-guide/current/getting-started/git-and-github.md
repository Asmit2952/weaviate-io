## Contributing to Weaviate using git and GitHub

This is a short guide on using git and GitHub to help you contribute to Weaviate. If you are relatively new to working on open-source projects, you may find this section helpful.

There are four major GitHub repositories of Weaviate, any of which you can contribute to. This includes:

* [Weaviate](https://github.com/semi-technologies/weaviate) - Weaviate's "core" codebase
* [Weaviate-io](https://github.com/semi-technologies/weaviate-io) - official Weaviate documentation
* [Weaviate Examples](https://github.com/semi-technologies/weaviate-examples) - apps built using Weaviate
* [Awesome Weaviate](https://github.com/semi-technologies/awesome-weaviate) - list of examples and tutorials on how to use Weaviate 

Generally speaking, the process to contribute using git and GitHub goes like this:

- Identify the right repository to contribute to. Then:
  - To report a bug or suggest an enhancement, [open an issue](#reporting-an-issue)
  - To contribute to the code base or the documentation:
    - [Fork the right repository on GitHub](#forking-the-repository)
    - [Clone the forked repository](#make-clone-a-local-copy)
    - [Create a new branch and make changes](#create-a-new-branch-to-work-on)
    - [Push your changes and create a pull request](#pull-request-process)

The below are some summary information on git and GitHub, as well as these steps.

## Git 

Git is a version control tool which keeps track of the changes you make to files, allowing you to go back to previous versions if necessary and keeping a record of what has been done.

Each set of tracked files is called a "repository", or a "repo". Each repo is typically contained in a directory.

You need to install Git on your computer before you can use it. If it's already installed, updating to the most recent version is probably a good idea. Read more about **installing git** [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

Once you have installed git, you can run commands like `git pull`, `git commit` or `git push` on the command line. This mode of activity is also called the git command-line interface (CLI).

## Using GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a website and cloud-based service for collaborating using git repositories. 

To be clear, you do not need a GitHub account to use Weaviate. But you will need one to contribute code or documentation to open source projects hosted on Github, which includes Weaviate.

You can create a GitHub account [here](https://github.com/join).

## Git vs. GitHub

Git is a version control tool. GitHub is an online platform that serves as a remote repository for git projects.

You can just use git on your local machine, but using a remote repository such as GitHub enables efficient collaboration with other team members.

Check out [**GitHub Skills**](https://skills.github.com/), a learning program provided by GitHub that will teach you the fundamentals of git and GitHub.

Now, let's talk about how we use git and GitHub to contribute to Weaviate.

## Report an issue

GitHub allows creation and tracking of "issues". These are typically used to manage bugs or feature requests. To create an "issue" on GitHub, go to the the issue tab in the relevant repository, and click "New issue."

![new issue](/img/guides/contributor/new_issue.png)

There are several templates available, such as documentation feedback, and bug reporting. If you want to create your own custom issue, go to the bottom left of the issue list box and click "Open a blank issue."

### Example: Create a new issue

Fill out each field based on the questions and guidance provided.

## Work with a fork

To work on a Weaviate repository, we recommend that you fork it first and then work on it. 

> A **fork** is your own copy of someone else's repository. Forks let you make changes to a project without affecting the original repository. You can fetch updates from or submit changes to the original repository with pull requests.

### Fork the repository

* To create a fork, go to the relevant GitHub repository and click the `Fork` button. This will create a copy of the repository (i.e. a fork) under your account.

![fork repo](/img/guides/contributor/fork.png)

The original repository is typically called the "upstream" repo.

### Make (clone) a local copy

* Now head over to the forked repository, and `clone` your repo. This will place a local copy of the repository on your machine so that you can make changes.

![clone repo](/img/guides/contributor/clone.png)

```
git clone git@github.com:<USERNAME>/weaviate.git
```

**Note:** ("weaviate" is used as the example repo. Make sure to cite the particular repository you are contributing to (for example, "weaviate-io")

* After cloning the repository from GitHub, use the `change directory` command to navigate to the cloned folder.

```
cd weaviate
```

Now you have a complete local copy of the repository! Here are some tips now on how to go about making changes to the repository, so that you can (hopefully) get them incorporated.

## Create a new branch to work on

Do not change files on a main branch, even if it is on your fork. 

It's best practice to create a new branch for each set of changes such as a new feature or bugfix. The reason is that it isolates each set of changes from the `main` branch so that each Pull Request can also be evaluated and managed independently.

Create a new branch with a simple informative name. For example:

- For enhancements use `feature/issue#` or `feature/nameOfFeature`
- For bugs use `bug/issue#` or `bug/nameOfBug`

To work with a new branch you can use either

```
git branch feature/newPage      #create a new branch
git checkout feature/newPage    #checkout on created branch
```

Or

```
git checkout -b feature/newPage  
```
**Note:** 
* `checkout` will switch to the newly created branch.
* `-b` will create a new branch if the branch doesnâ€™t already exist

This will create a new branch and move to it. Now, start hacking away and making any modifications you want.

## Check git status

After you've fixed the issue and tested it (Tests are critical! Never submit a change that hasn't been tested), you can keep track of your progress using this command:

```
git status
```

This will show you which files are currently being modified and which branch you're working on.

## Create a Pull Request

A few considerations must be made before submitting a Pull Request. Your Pull Request will be merged more quickly if your branch is cleaned up.

If any commits to the `upstream <default> branch` have been made during the period you've been working on your changes, you will need to `rebase` your development branch so that merging it will be a fast-forward process without requiring any effort on conflict resolution.

Fetch the upstream main branch and update your local repository by following these [steps on how to incorporate upstream changes](#how-to-incorporate-upstream-changes).

Rebase your development branch if there were any new commits

```
git checkout feature/newPage
git rebase <default>
```

### Pull Request process

A "Pull Request" (PR), as the name suggests, requests that another party pull your changes to their repository. In this case, you creating a PR means requesting that someone managing the Weaviate repo pull in changes from your fork. If successful, your changes will become a part of the upstream repository!

Here are some general guidelines about how to submit a Pull Request:

* If you're making visual changes, include a screenshot of the affected element before and after

* Update the documentation if you change any user-facing functionality in Weaviate

* Each Pull Request should implement one new feature or fix one bug. Submit multiple Pull Requests if you want to add or fix multiple items.

* Do not commit changes to files that are irrelevant to your feature or bug fix

* Write a good commit message. Check out [commit guidelines](./commit-guidelines.html)

**Adding the files and committing:**

Make sure you are on your development branch

* Add your files to the staging area

```
git add filename
```

You can also use `git add .` to stage all the files, but it is not recommended to use. You might include created files, backups, and configuration files containing information you don't want included. Prior to adding files to the staging area, always validate visually which files need to be staged.

* Check if the files are added in the staging area

```
git status
```

* If everything is good to go, proceed with commiting your changes with a **good commit message**. More information on how to write good commit messages can be found on this [page](./commit-guidelines.html).

```
git commit -m "your commit message"
```
**Pushing the commit:**

* Now you must push to the remote repository so that your GitHub repo reflects changes made to your local repo. You can do so with:

```
git push origin feature/newPage
```

If asked, enter your GitHub login credentials. When complete, your commit will be on your forked GitHub repository.

When all of your changes have been committed and pushed to GitHub, visit the page for your fork there, choose the development branch, and then press the `Compare & Pull Request` button. 

![create Pull Request](/img/guides/contributor/pull_request.png)

If you need to make any further commits to your Pull Request, simply check out your development branch and push the updates to GitHub. Your Pull Request will automatically keep track of and update the commits made to your development branch.

* Complete the Pull Request by filling out our [Pull Request template](https://github.com/semi-technologies/weaviate/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)

![Pull Request template](/img/guides/contributor/pull_request_temp.png)

* Once your changes are ready, make sure you [self review](#self-reviewing-pull-requests) your Pull Request to speed up the review process.

## Self reviewing Pull Requests

You should always review your own Pull Request first.

For any changes you commit, make sure that you:

* Confirm that the changes meet the objectives of the issue you created or are working on.

* Compare your Pull Request's source changes to staging to ensure that the output matches the source and that everything is rendering as expected. This assists in detecting issues such as typos or content that isn't rendering due to versioning issues.

* If there are any failing checks in your PR, try troubleshooting them until they are passing or [ask for help](https://weaviate.slack.com/).

### Documentation-specific guidelines

* Check for technical accuracy in the content. You can always [ask for help](https://weaviate.slack.com/) if you get stuck.

* Verify that the syntax of new or updated Liquid statements is proper. Jekyll uses the [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) templating language to process templates.

## After submitting a Pull Request

After you've created the Pull Request, there are two possibilities:

* Your PR will be accepted, and your commit will be merged into the `<default>` branch, congratulations!

* Your PR will require further attention. This may happen due to:
  * Irrelevant or breaking changes
  * Reviewer wants something changed

Working with git and GitHub can be intimidating at first, but it is a core part of how the open-source community works together to create such amazing tools. If you have any further questions, you can reach out to us also.

## Additional git / GitHub tips
### How to incorporate upstream changes

A fork separates a repository from its upstream equivalent. So, you will need to pull upstream changes from time to time to keep your fork up to date with changes made upstream. 

To do this, first track the upstream repo by adding a remote upstream URL to the local repository.

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/semi-technologies/weaviate.git
```

* To check if your local copy properly references the upstream repository on GitHub, run the command below

```
git remote -v
```

You should see:

```
origin    https://github.com/Your_Username/weaviate.git (fetch)
origin    https://github.com/Your_Username/weaviate.git (push)
upstream  https://github.com/semi-technologies/weaviate.git (fetch)
upstream  https://github.com/semi-technologies/weaviate.git (push)
```

To bring in upstream changes to your fork, you need to fetch and pull the upstream repo's branches and commits. The below are two ways that you can do this:

* [Using GitHub and git CLI](#using-github-and-git-cli)
* [Using git CLI](#using-git-cli)

#### Fetch upstream with GitHub and git CLI

* The first step is to incorporate any upstream changes to your forked repository. Head over to the forked GitHub repository, and under `Fetch Upstream`, click `Fetch and merge`. 

* The next step is to bring those changes to the local repository. If you have made any changes, make sure to commit them locally. Then check out the `main` (or `master` for weaviate) branch like so:

```
git checkout main
```

> Note, the `weaviate` project uses `master` as its default branch, while `weaviate-io` uses `main`. Pick tbe right branch name based on the project you use.

* Then pull the changes into local repository

```
git pull origin main
```

This will update your local repository to reflect your remote, forked repository.

#### Fetch upstream with git CLI

Or you can just use the git CLI as below: 

* Check out the `main` branch first

```
git checkout main
```

* Fetch the upstream changes 

```
git fetch upstream
```

* Then pull any changes from the upstream `main` branch into the current local branch (i.e. `main` - checked out earlier)

```
git pull upstream main
```

* Last, push to your own remote repository (named `origin`) to keep the forked GitHub repo in sync

```
git push origin main
```

One liner script for super users:

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/semi-technologies/weaviate.git || true && git fetch upstream && git checkout main && git pull upstream main && git push origin main
```

### View all branches including remote branches

```
git branch -a
```
