The Weaviate community produces a lot of great content including blog posts, tutorials, and demo applications. To help these reach the broader community, we maintain a curated list of these in our [Awesome Weaviate](https://github.com/semi-technologies/awesome-weaviate) repository. 

If you would like to share your own work, we would love to hear from you. We can help it reach the wider Weaviate community, who will in turn benefit from your work. 

Here are some ideas and tips on how:

## Write a blog post or tutorial

You could contribute by writing a blog post, or tutorial relating to Weaviate. 

It could be about anything from your Weaviate journey, concepts you've learnt and used with Weaviate like vector search engines, or guides on how to integrate Weaviate with something. 

It can be hosted anywhere. It could be at a well-known platform such as Medium, Dev.to, or HashNode, or somewhere smaller like your own blog.

We ask of your article to:

* Be freely accessible
* Use the `weaviate` tag (where applicable)
* Use code blocks, rather than screenshots of code (for usability)

## Develop a demo app

You could also contribute by creating a demo application that uses Weaviate under the hood. It can be a web app, mobile app or demos showing certain [integrations](/product.html).

We ask for the app to:

* Be unique
* Include a descriptive README.md file if possible
* Disclose the Weaviate [module(s)](/developers/weaviate/current/modules/index.html) used

## Create a PR when ready

When you are ready to share your work, create a pull request in [Awesome Weaviate](https://github.com/semi-technologies/awesome-weaviate) repository.
