Welcome to the Weaviate **Concepts: Core**. 

The purpose of these documents is to equip you with the core knowledge required to understand and use Weaviate. These pages are designed for you to read through, including on your phone.

We aim to provide you with an overview of what Weaviate is and what its core components are, as well as a little bit of how they work. By the time you are done reading these pages, you should have some familiarity with Weaviate and its components. You may then wish to move onto our in-depth explanations about Weaviate's [architecture](../architecture/index.md) or those relating to [vector space](../vectorization/index.md).

These "Concepts" sections are largely theoretical, and you can treat them as background reading. If you are looking to get started using Weaviate, we recommend checking out the [getting started guide](../getting-started/index.md), and the [references] section provides specifics of various aspects, such as endpoints, client libraries, schema or modules. 

## Before you start 

Here, we make a few basic assumptions (you are somewhat familiar with databases, know what vector embeddings are, and can read basic JSON and GraphQL).
