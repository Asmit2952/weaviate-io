:::caution NOTE:
The "Concepts: Core" sections come from
- Core Knowledge in Weaviate Docs Classic, minus:
  - "Console", which is now in Tutorials: Further Topics.
  - "Clients", which has been added to Client-libraries/index
- Modules, from Modules:Index + some of the theory in Configuration:Modules in Weaviate Docs Classic
- Vector indexing, from Vector Index (ANN) Plugins:Index in Weaviate Docs Classic

## Overview

Welcome to the Weaviate **Concepts: Core**.

This section focusses on the core **knowledge** required to understand and use Weaviate. That includes an overview of what Weaviate is and what its core components are, as well as a little bit of how they work. 

By the time you are done reading these pages, you should have some familiarity with Weaviate and its components. You may then wish to move onto our in-depth explanations about Weaviate's [architecture](../architecture/index.md).

These "Concepts" sections are largely theoretical, and you can treat them as background reading. If you are after something more practical, the [quickstart tutorial](../getting-started/index.md) will help you. Then, the [references](../references/index.md) section provides specifics of various aspects, such as endpoints, client libraries, schema or modules.

## Before you start 

Here, we make a few basic assumptions (you are somewhat familiar with databases, know what vector embeddings are, and can read basic JSON and GraphQL).
