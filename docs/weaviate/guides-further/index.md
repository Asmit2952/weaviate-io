# intro: How-to guides help you to get more familiar with Weaviate. You will learn how to get started, how to interact with the data, how to perform more advanced actions like semantic search and classification, and how to interpret and evaluate the results. These guides are more elaborate then the API references, to give you some background idea which might help you to understand the workflow and possibilities.

These guides are designed to be consumed after becoming familiar with [how to use](../guides/index.md) Weaviate, and to [configure](/docs/weaviate/configuration/index.md) Weaviate to your needs.

As such, these *further* guides are a little more specific, much as recipes tend to be in cooking, whereas the earlier sections can be thought as general guides on cooking.

You can read them in any order, and depending on your needs or interests, you may decide to skip them altogether.
