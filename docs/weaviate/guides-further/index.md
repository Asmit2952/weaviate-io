# intro: How-to guides help you to get more familiar with Weaviate. You will learn how to get started, how to interact with the data, how to perform more advanced actions like semantic search and classification, and how to interpret and evaluate the results. These guides are more elaborate then the API references, to give you some background idea which might help you to understand the workflow and possibilities.

These guides are designed to be consumed after becoming familiar with [how to use](../guides/index.md) Weaviate, and to [configure](/docs/weaviate/configuration/index.md) Weaviate to your needs.

As such, these *further* guides dive a little deeper to show you how to achieve specific goals and tasks. You can think of them as the equivalent of *recipes* in cooking, in contrast to something like a the [Getting started guide](../getting-started/index.md) which is most similar to a *cooking class*.

Each of these guides are self-contained. So you can read them in any order.
