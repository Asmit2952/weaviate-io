## Overview

You would have seen in the earlier [Installation section](../installation/index.md) for Docker Compose or Kubernetes that Weaviate's settings can be changed by modifying the relevant configuration file.

Weaviate's default configurations are designed to get our new users up and running quickly to try out vector search. But the configuration options will allow many to customize Weaviate to suit their specific needs, or to get it to a production-ready state.

This section is a collection of guides to delve further into the details on how to configure various settings and customize Weaviate to suit your needs.

You do not need to read this section linearly. But we do recommend that you browse through this section so that you are aware of the available main customization options, including features that will help you to take it into production.
